# Dev-tool-landing-page-cursor

Here,I recreated a developer tool landing page,inspired by the Cursor Website. I tried to make this page look as close as possible to cursor website. I have recreated top navigation bar,hero section,trusted by logos, two-coloumn-layout, feature card section,quote cards with name and role,list of updates with dates,CTA and in footer section multi-coloumn links and company information.
